    <title>Freak Fandome's Totally Real Lasagna</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>My Totally Real and Beloved Lasagna</h1>
    <p>The tomato sauce and bechamel is made from scratch, but the pasta can be boxed or pre-made just to save some time. My family has splurged over how banging of a lasagna this is, so I hope you'll enjoy making and eating this lasagna as much as I and my family have.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There will be NO precise measurements, just approximates. Use your heart and mind.</p>
